* My personal Emacs configuration
Hacking journey begins start from 2013.

It was written for Emacs 25.1+ on MacOS 10.11+

** How to use
Follow the install instruction here: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs#install ,
make sure your are using the fork repo: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs

Why use the forked repo?  What's the difference between the forked repo and the original repo?

*Nothing difference!*

The forked version is only a few commits behind the original repo, becuase sometimes the original repo can't functional well.

** What's the highlight of this configuration
1. It's a highly optimized Spacemacs configuration, you should use the configuration together with the *develop* branch of the forked Spacemacs.
2. I prefer to the =Ivy= completion interface, so I removed many helm related packages but keep the =helm-ag= package. The =counsel-ag= counterpart is not powerful as =helm-ag=.
3. I also removed some packages I don't have any chance to use. The complete list lies in the exclude section of the =init.el= file.
4. I also exclude the =Spaceline= package, cause it's easy to frozen the Emacs with this package enabled. So I create my own mode line configuration based on =Spaceline=.
5. The =Swiper= package sometimes frozen the Emacs UI when you split the window with very long lines. You could use `pkill -SIGUSR2 -i emacs` in command line to save the frozen Emacs.

** Optional    
*** Install Imagemagick 
*** Add ispell support: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-04/msg00030.html
